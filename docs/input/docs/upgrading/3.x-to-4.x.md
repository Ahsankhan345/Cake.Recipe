## Required Changes

### Switch to using Cake 2.3.0

Cake.Recipe is now using 2.3.0 of Cake, and as such, we recommend that any build using Cake.Recipe also targets using 2.3.0 of Cake.  We recommend that you follow the [upgrade instructions for Cake itself](https://cakebuild.net/docs/getting-started/upgrade#cake-1.x-to-cake-2.0), to ensure that there aren't any additional changes that you would need to make.
