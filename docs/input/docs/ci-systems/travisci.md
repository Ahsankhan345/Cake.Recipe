Title: Travis CI
Description: Running on Travis CI
---

## Specifics

* `Upload-Artifacts`-Task

  Travis CI does not have artifacts storage therefore uploading artifacts is not supported in Cake.Recipe. 

* `actions/checkout`

  The default for `fetch-depth` currently does not work with `GitVersion`. Set `depth: false` under `git:` to fetch all history for all branches.

## Example Config

:::{.alert .alert-info}
**NOTE:**

The example shows a build-configuration for Travis CI, using windows. 
Keep in mind using windows in Travis CI is currently an [early release](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/windows)
and not everything is fully supported.

The current list of available environments for Travis-CI can be found in [the documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/overview/).
